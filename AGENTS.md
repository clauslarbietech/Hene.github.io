# Cloud Agent Handoff — Hene Portfolio (`HENE.com`)

Use this file as the **system prompt / operating brief** when continuing work in a Cursor Cloud Agent (or any remote agent) on this repository.

---

## Mission

Ship and maintain **Hene**, a static photography portfolio for **GitHub Pages**.

- **Repo name:** `HENE.com` (exact)
- **Default branch:** `main`
- **Stack:** React 19 + Vite 6 + React Router (no Flask in production)
- **Live inspiration:** https://www.iamhene.com/ (Squarespace; we rebuilt, did not migrate theme code)
- **Contact:** imheneinfo@gmail.com · https://www.linkedin.com/in/claus-larbie-0ab15460

---

## Current status (as of last local handoff)

### Done
- Static Vite app under [`frontend/`](frontend/)
- Site content: [`frontend/src/data/site.json`](frontend/src/data/site.json)
- Images: [`frontend/public/images/`](frontend/public/images/) (~22 web-optimized assets)
- Home: **4-cover grid** → Beauty / Mood Board / Journey / Just Create
- Gallery pages + lightbox (keyboard + swipe)
- Vite `base: "/HENE.com/"` for project Pages URL
- SPA fallback: `npm run build` copies `dist/index.html` → `dist/404.html`
- Deploy workflow: [`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)
- Flask backend **removed** from runtime

### Blocked / next for cloud agent
1. Ensure this repo exists on GitHub as **`HENE.com`** and `main` is pushed.
2. Enable **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.
3. Confirm site loads at `https://<owner>.github.io/HENE.com/`.
4. Optional later: custom domain `www.iamhene.com` + set Vite `base` to `/`.

---

## Prompt architecture (how to operate)

### Role
You are the implementation agent for Hene. Prefer small, reviewable commits. Do not invent a CMS or reintroduce Flask unless the user asks.

### Goals (priority order)
1. **Publish** — repo on GitHub + Pages green
2. **Correctness** — build succeeds; routes and images resolve under `/HENE.com/`
3. **Polish** — photography UX (grid, lightbox, motion) without clutter
4. **Content** — update `site.json` + `public/images` when user adds photos

### Non-goals
- Flask / Python API in production
- Storing RAW/TIFF originals in git
- Editing the attached Cursor plan file outside the repo

### Decision rules
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Need to change routes or IA | Keep 4 series: `beauty`, `mood-board`, `journey`, `just-create` |
| Image paths | Relative like `images/foo.jpg`; resolve via [`frontend/src/asset.js`](frontend/src/asset.js) |
| Custom domain attached at root | Set `base: "/"` in [`frontend/vite.config.js`](frontend/vite.config.js) |
| User asks for GitHub Pages only | Stay static; never require a server at runtime |
| Commits | Only when user asks, or when handoff explicitly requires publish |
| Secrets | Never commit tokens; use `gh auth` / Actions OIDC |

```

## Commands

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev      # local; note base path /HENE.com/
npm run build    # must succeed; produces dist/ + 404.html
npm run preview
```

### Publish (if remote missing)

```bash
gh auth status
gh repo create "HENE.com" --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

Or: `pwsh scripts/push-to-github.ps1`

Then: repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → GitHub Actions**.

---

## Acceptance checks

- [ ] `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build` exits 0 with no backend
- [ ] Home shows brand **Hene** + 4 covers linking to the four series
- [ ] Lightbox: Esc / arrows / touch swipe; counter visible
- [ ] Deep link `/HENE.com/beauty` works on Pages (404.html fallback)
- [ ] Workflow `Deploy GitHub Pages` succeeds on `main`
- [ ] README matches actual stack (static React, not Flask)

---

## Suggested first cloud-agent prompt

Copy-paste this into the cloud agent to continue:

```text
Read AGENTS.md and README.md in this repo.

Continue the Hene portfolio handoff:
1. Verify frontend builds (`cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build`).
2. Ensure remote is github.com/<owner>/HENE.com on branch main; create/push if needed.
3. Confirm GitHub Pages is set to GitHub Actions and the deploy workflow passes.
4. Smoke-check routes: /, /beauty, /mood-board, /journey, /just-create under base /HENE.com/.
5. Report the live Pages URL and any blockers.

Do not reintroduce Flask. Do not edit unrelated plan files. Prefer small commits only if changes are required.
```

## Design constraints (brief)

- Brand-first home; one composition; 4 equal covers (not a carousel)
- Distinctive type (Syne + Cormorant already wired in `index.html`)
- Motion: cover hover, page enter, lightbox transition
- No card chrome in galleries; masonry/column mosaic is fine

---

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- **App location:** all install/build/dev commands run in `frontend/` (lockfile is `package-lock.json`, so use npm). Standard commands are in `README.md` and `frontend/package.json`.
- **Base path gotcha:** Vite `base` is `/HENE.com/`, so the dev server serves at `http://localhost:5173/HENE.com/`, **not** `http://localhost:5173/`. The bare root and any deep route/image requested outside `/HENE.com/` will 404 — always include the base prefix when curling or browsing (e.g. `/HENE.com/beauty`, `/HENE.com/images/<file>.jpg`).
- **No lint or test scripts exist.** `frontend/package.json` only defines `dev`, `build`, and `preview`; there is no linter or test runner configured, so "run lint/tests" is a no-op for this repo.
- **Build side effect:** `npm run build` runs Vite then `scripts/spa-fallback.mjs`, which copies `dist/index.html` → `dist/404.html` for SPA deep-link fallback on GitHub Pages. A build is only complete when `dist/404.html` is written.
- **Purely static:** no backend/server, no env vars, and no secrets are needed to run or build locally.
